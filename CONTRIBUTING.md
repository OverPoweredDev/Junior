# Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcome! As Junior is a project in release, changes to the source code won't be immediately accepted. In case it's a new feature
or something not mentioned below, just create an issue beforehand please. Also feel free to add your name and account to the Maintainer's section while making a
PR!

Contributions regarding the below are especially appreciated!

- Contributing to the README (The TODO parts, mainly sweat_smile)
- Adding Pages to the Wiki
- Minor changes/refactors to the Flutter Code
- Adding features to the Application requested by users
- Adding tests for the app

One thing I ask of you guys is to follow the directory structure as shown in [this section](https://github.com/OverPoweredDev/Junior#navigation). Also run the following commands before any pull
request so that it doesn't cause issues with the linter. And fix any minor issues it brings up!

```shell
flutter format --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze .
```
