# Junior Changelogs

I'll just store all the changelogs for all versions here till I find a better alternative

## 1.0.0

### 1.0.1

### 1.0.2

## 1.1.0
NONE

## 1.2.0
NONE

### 1.2.1
NONE

### 1.2.2

A lot of new stuff with this update, I'll go by importance

𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴/𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝗽 I'm going to eventually mess up so please keep your data backed up locally. I know nobody actually
remembers this so I've also set automatic exporting up on every novel edit. Please keep this on so you maintain your data no matter what

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗲 Check it out!

𝗧𝗼𝗴𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁/𝗗𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲 Dark Mode is still default and Light mode kinda sucks but it's there now

𝗔 𝗪𝗵𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗮 𝗨𝗜 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 Mainly in the settings page

As for where 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 went, it was too buggy so I had to add patches but I was also adding features so we're at 1.2.2 now

### 1.2.3

The previous update caused a lot of savefiles in Downloads. A fix for now is storing it all in a dedicated folder

### 1.2.4

Along with it's dedicated folder, AutoSaves are now only saved once a day

## 1.3.0

This Young Master has been silent but that's only to break through the bottleneck and reach a whole new realm! Junior has recieved a lot of contributions and
nearly a month's worth of effort later, it now supports:

𝗩𝗼𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗲/𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 Click on the 'Volume' word in the details page for any novel and you'll find support for adding Volumes along with
Chapters! This was heavily requested when I'd posted about Junior so I'm glad I could get this out.

𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀 Novels now aren't just Ongoing or Complete. Tap on the status next to your chapter count to cycle it through Ongoing, Complete, To Read
and On Hiatus.

𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗧𝗮𝗴𝘀 A change I'm particularly excited about! Novel Tags can be entered as a comma separated list in the Details Page and it'll show up as a
proper list of tags on the Novel Tile on your home page. So you can finally mark your Novels by Language, Genre, Website, anything else you want!

𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 Search doesn't only search by title anymore. Try inputting your notes, your rating, the novel tags or even the link you've given.
Works for all of these!

Finally, there are minor updates like showing a small tooltip after updating, etc. but those don't affect your experience. So try out all the new features and
be sure to let me know how they feel!
